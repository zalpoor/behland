**Proof of Human Work on TON**

BehLand is a human-centric Web3 ecosystem designed to record learning, effort, and consistency as verifiable work on-chain.

While Bitcoin secures networks through machines (Proof of Work) and Ethereum through capital (Proof of Stake), BehLand introduces a new primitive:
**Proof of Human Work (POHW)** — where time, focus, learning, and discipline become meaningful economic signals.

## What BehLand Is
- A gamified financial-literacy ecosystem
- Built natively on TON
- Focused on long-term human growth
- Designed around learning, not speculation

## What BehLand Is Not
- Not a trading platform
- Not a hype-driven token
- Not a short-term reward game

## Core Concepts
- Proof of Human Work (POHW)
- Learning-based identity
- Effort-driven progression
- Sustainable rewards
- Human-based governance

## Status
BehLand is under active development.
